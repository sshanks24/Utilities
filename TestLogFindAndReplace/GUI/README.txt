** find_and_replace_gui.xrc must be located in the same directory as find_and_replace_gui.exe

The "top level directory" is currently hard coded to "I:\LMG TEST ENGINEERING\TestLog".

Two log files are created by the executable each time it is run in the top level directory:

	.FindAndReplace.log - contains standard error and standard output; should be empty on a succesful run.
	FindAndReplaceResults.txt - contains a list of the files that were found by the utility.
